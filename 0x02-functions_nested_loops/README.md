Functions in C:
A function is a self-contained block of code that performs a specific task. It is designed to be reusable and can be called multiple times from different parts of the program. Functions help in modularizing the code, making it easier to read, understand, and maintain. They have a name, a return type (if any), and can accept parameters (input) and return a value (output) if necessary
Nested Loops in C:
A loop is a control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code until a certain condition is met. Nested loops are loops within loops, which means one loop is placed inside another. They are useful when dealing with multi-dimensional data structures like arrays or when you need to perform repetitive tasks in a structured manner.
